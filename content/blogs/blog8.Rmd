# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?

Our team has been tasked with the analysis of alcoholic beverages consumption per country. Our clients want to know how is the beer, wine and spirits consumption per country.
Back in 2014, [fivethiryeight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/) published an article on alcohol consumption in different countries. We used the dataset from fivethirtyeight.com to perform our exploration.


```{r, load_alcohol_data}
#The first thing we need to do is loading the relevant datasets!

#Load the library fivethirtyeight
library(fivethirtyeight)
#Load the data drinks
data(drinks)

# Another way to have loaded the alcohol direct would have been the following one:
# alcohol_direct <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv")
```

## Checking data quality for drinks dataset

After loading the data we need to ensure its quality by checking for duplicates and NAs.

```{r glimpse_skim_data}
# We need to check whether any of the drinks is duplicated
anyDuplicated(drinks)

# We need to check whether there are any NA drinks
anyNA(drinks)

```
Based on checking the dataset, there are no missing values or any duplicates. 

## Top 25 beer consuming countries

```{r beer_plot}
# Get the data from drinks and create a variable top_beer
top_beer <- drinks %>%
# Arrange the beer consuming countries in descending order
  arrange(desc(beer_servings))

# Plot the findings; use head to choose the top 25 beer consuming countries
ggplot(head(top_beer, 25), aes(x=reorder(country, beer_servings), y = beer_servings)) +
  # Customize the plot; add the titles, and the axes labels
  labs(y = "Servings of Beer", x = "", title = "Namibians like beer the most!",
       subtitle="Beer consumption by country") +
  # Use geom bar for categorical variables
  geom_bar(stat='identity', show.legend = FALSE, fill = 'red') +
  #Flip the coordinates
  coord_flip() +
  #Customize the theme
  theme_clean()
```

## Top 25 wine consuming countries

```{r wine_plot}
# Get the data from drinks and create a variable top_wine
top_wine <- drinks %>%
  # Arrange the wine consuming countries in descending order
  arrange(desc(wine_servings))

 # Plot the findings; use head to choose the top 25 wine consuming countries 
ggplot(head(top_wine, 25), aes(x=reorder(country, wine_servings), y = wine_servings)) +
  # Customize the plot; add the titles, and the axes labels
  labs(y = "Servings of Wine", x = "", title = "French are wine number 1 consumers!",
       subtitle = "Wine consumption by country") +
   # Use geom bar for categorical variables
  geom_bar(stat='identity', show.legend = FALSE, fill = 'lightblue') + 
 #Flip the coordinates
  coord_flip() +
   #Customize the theme
  theme_clean()

```

## Top 25 spirit consuming countries

```{r spirit_plot}
# Get the data from drinks and create a variable top_spirits
top_spirits <- drinks %>%
 # Arrange the spirit consuming countries in descending order
  arrange(desc(spirit_servings))

# Plot the findings; use head to choose the top 25 spirit consuming countries 
ggplot(head(top_spirits, 25), aes(x=reorder(country, spirit_servings), y = spirit_servings)) +
   # Customize the plot; add the titles, and the axes labels
  labs(y = "Servings of Spirits", x = "",title="Grenadians are the greatest spirit consumers! ",subtitle = "Spirit Consumption by country") +
  geom_bar(stat='identity', show.legend = FALSE, fill = 'green') + 
   # Flip the coordinates
  coord_flip() +
   # Customize the theme
  theme_clean()

```

Consumption of alcoholic beverages differs across geographies and exposes national preferences and traditions in terms of beers, spirits and wines. Looking at the example of wine consumption, highest consumption per capita can be seen for countries with traditionally high production of wine (France, Portugal) while Switzerland and Denmark are more on the side of consumption. Overall, consumption patterns in terms of beverages likely align to a large extend with the national cuisine and food preferences, i.e. beer being paired with traditional German style meals.
