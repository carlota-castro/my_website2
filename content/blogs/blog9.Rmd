# Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset

For the following analysis, we use a subset sample of movies, taken from the [Kaggle IMDB 5000 movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset)

  
```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
url <- "https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset"
#Create a variable movies that stores the movies read from the file movies.csv
movies <- vroom::vroom(file = 'data/movies.csv')
```

The dataset consists of the following variable: Besides the obvious variables of `title`, `genre`, `director`, `year`, and `duration`, the rest of the variables are as follows:

* `title`: Movie title
* `genre`: Movie genre
* `director`: Movie director
* `year`: Year the movie was published
* `duration`: Duration of the movie
* `gross`: The gross earnings in the US box office, not adjusted for inflation
* `budget`: The movie's budget 
* `cast_facebook_likes`: the number of facebook likes cast members received
* `votes`: the number of people who voted for (or rated) the movie in IMDB 
* `reviews`: the number of reviews for that movie
* `rating`: IMDB average rating 

## Data exploration of the movies dataset

### Data structure

There are no missing values (NAs) in the dataset. Equally, there are no duplicate rows (= identical for each column) but there is a total of **54** duplicate rows based on titles, director, year and movie duration. The duplicates differ on the number of votes and thus the rating. For the following analysis, we removed the duplicate rows and chose a random value for the movie rating. 

```{r glimpse_skim_data2}

# Checking for missing values
anyNA(movies)

# Checking if there are duplicates based on title, director, year, duration

dupes <- movies %>%
  #Select the variables tile, director, year and duration from the dataset
  select(title, director, year, duration) %>%
  # Check for duplicates with function duplicated()
  duplicated()

table(dupes)["TRUE"]

# Create the variable movies cleaned that contains the movies without duplicates 
movies_cleaned <- movies[!dupes,]

```

### Movies per genre
We want to determine how many movies there are per genre. Hence, we will create a table with two columns: genre and movie count.

```{r, question2}
# Create a variable movies per genre from movies_cleaned
movies_by_genre <- movies_cleaned %>%
   #group by genre
  group_by(genre) %>%
  #Count the number of movies by each genre and sort in 
  #descending order
  count(sort = TRUE)
#movies_by_genre

# Create a table with the columns corresponding to Genre and Movie Count employing the library kableExtra

movies_by_genre %>%
  #Define the names of the columns 
  kbl(col.names = c("Genre", "Movie count")) %>%
  #Choose the theme for the table
  kable_material(c("hover")) %>%
  #Fix the table header at the top = false
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = F)%>%
  #Specify the background color for the relevant columns
  column_spec(1:2, background = "blue")
```
### Financial performance

The aim of this section is to determine the financial performance of the movies. We will determine, firstly, the mean gross; secondly, the mean budget; thirdly, the mean return, defined as gross earning/gross budget (i.e. how many dollars $ a movie made at the box office for each $ of its budget). All the values are given in millions of dollars.

```{r, question3}
# Analyze financial performance of the movies
genre_gross_budget <- movies_cleaned %>%
  # Create variable return_on_budget = gross/budget
  mutate(return_on_budget = gross/budget) %>%
  # Group the movies by genre
  group_by(genre) %>%
  # Calculate the mean gross, mean budget (dividing them by 1,000,000 to get the result
  # in million dollars), and mean return
  summarize(mean_gross = mean(gross)/1000000, mean_budget = mean(budget)/1000000, 
            mean_return = mean(return_on_budget)) %>%
  #Arrange by return in descending order
  arrange(desc(mean_return))

#Give genre_gross_budget as an input to the table. Note, need to use package kableExtra
genre_gross_budget %>% 
  #Define the names of the columns  
 kbl(col.names = c("Genre", "Mean Gross", "Mean Budget", "Mean Return"), digits = 2) %>%
  #Choose the theme for the table 
  kable_material(c("hover")) %>%
  #Fix the table header at the top = False
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = F)%>%
  #Specify the background color for the relevant columns
  column_spec(1:4, background = "blue")
```
This table shows that the most profitable movies are by far horror movies. This genre could be considered as an outlier since it is on average 4 times more profitable than the second on the list, which is Biography. Conversely, the least profitable genre is “Thriller” and it is unexpectedly low. However, it would not be relevant to assert that it is not a profitable genre, since there is only 1 thriller movie in our data frame. As a rule of thumb, we could assume that it would be difficult to conclude without a significant sample size of at least n=30 movies. Hence,  we will not comment on which genre is the least profitable one, but it is fair to conclude that horror movies are indeed very profitable.

### Top directors
After determining the number of movies per genre, and the financial performance, we want to understand the directors behind the films.
```{r, question4}
#Create dataframe top directors
top_directors <- movies_cleaned %>%
  #Group by director
  group_by(director) %>%
  #Summarize tje total gross and mean gross, median, std deviation in millions of dollars.
  summarize(total = sum(gross)/1000000, mean = mean(gross)/1000000,
            median = median(gross)/1000000, st_dev=STDEV(gross)) %>%
  #Arrange in descencing order
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  #Choose the top 15 values
  head(15)

top_directors %>%
  #Create table 
  kbl(col.names = c("Director", "Total Revenue", "Mean Revenue", "Median Revenue", "SD of Revenue")) %>%
  kable_material(c("hover")) %>%
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = F)%>%
  column_spec(1, bold = T, border_right = F) %>%
  column_spec(1:5, background = "blue")
```
### Ratings distribution
The next question we want to analyse is: how are the ratings of the movies grouped by gender distributed? Are some genres generally more highly rated than others?

```{r, question5}
#Create data.frame genre_ratings
genre_ratings <- movies_cleaned %>%
  #Group by genre
  group_by(genre) %>%
  #Calculate some statistical variables: minimum, maximum, mean,median, standard deviation of the ratings.
  summarize(Minimum_Rating = min(rating), Max_Rating = max(rating), 
            Mean_Rating = mean(rating), Median_Rating = median(rating), 
            st_dev=STDEV(rating))

#Create density plots for each of the genders
ggplot(movies, aes(x = rating, group = genre)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4, show.legend = F, fill = 'lightblue') +
  #Add the title, x and y labels
  labs(title = "Density distribution of ratings by genre", x = "Rating", y = "Density") +
  #Wrap by genre 
  facet_wrap(~genre) +
  #Choose the theme for the plots
  theme_clean()
 
```
It is interesting to notice that while horror  movies were the most profitable ones, they are also the most disliked movies (after the thriller movie which represents an unsignificant sample). Conversely, Biography movies are the most liked ones and are also very profitable. Perhaps movies are a great source of inspiration, and while there is no dearth of good fictional movies, what really inspires people are biographies.

## Facebook likes and gross sales of a movie?
Further to the analyses conducted so far, we want to further understand if the number of Facebook likes on a social media affects gross sales of a movie. Does having more facebook likes lead to a greater number of sales of a movie? Let's see!

```{r, gross_on_fblikes}
#Create a scatter plot having the number of facebook likes on the x axis and gross on the y-axis.
ggplot(movies, aes(x = cast_facebook_likes, y = gross)) +
  #Specify the title, the x-label and the y-label
  labs(title= "Relationship between facebook likes and \ngross sales of a movie", x = "# Likes", y = "Gross ($)") +
  #Indicate type of plot
  geom_point() +
  #Determine the format: if scales::comma, the scientific format is replaced
  #by a number with all the zeros
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  #Choose the theme
  theme_clean()

#Calculate the correlation coefficient using function cor()
movies %>%
  summarize(correlation = cor(cast_facebook_likes,gross)^2)

```
There is no direct relationship between the number of facebook likes and the gross sales of a movie which may likely be due to the fact that movies are not primarily promoted though individual facebook pages. The R squared is 0.0454, indicating no significant correlation between the two variables. 

A final question we aim to answer to conclude our analysis of this set of movies is: does a higher budget lead to a higher gross?

```{r, gross_on_budget}

ggplot(movies, aes(x = budget, y = gross)) +
  #Add the title, x and y labels
  labs(title= "Relationship between budget and gross sales of a movie", x = "Budget ($)", y = "Gross ($)") +
  #Specify the type of plot
  geom_point() + 
  #Add a linear regression trendline
  geom_smooth() +
  #Add the dollar sign next to the number in the axes
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  #Add the theme
  theme_clean()


#Correlation coefficient
movies %>%
  #Calculate the correlation number using cor
  summarize(correlation = cor(budget,gross)^2)

```
