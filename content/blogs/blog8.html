Consumption of alcoholic beverages differs across geographies and exposes national preferences and traditions in terms of beers, spirits and wines. Looking at the example of wine consumption, highest consumption per capita can be seen for countries with traditionally high production of wine (France, Portugal) while Switzerland and Denmark are more on the side of consumption. Overall, consumption patterns in terms of beverages likely align to a large extend with the national cuisine and food preferences, i.e.Â beer being paired with traditional German style meals.</p>
