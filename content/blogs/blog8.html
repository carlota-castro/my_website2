<h1>Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?</h1>
<p>Our team has been tasked with the analysis of alcoholic beverages consumption per country. Our clients want to know how is the beer, wine and spirits consumption per country.
Back in 2014, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/">fivethiryeight.com</a> published an article on alcohol consumption in different countries. We used the dataset from fivethirtyeight.com to perform our exploration.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#The first thing we need to do is loading the relevant datasets!

#Load the library fivethirtyeight
library(fivethirtyeight)
#Load the data drinks
data(drinks)

# Another way to have loaded the alcohol direct would have been the following one:
# alcohol_direct &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/alcohol-consumption/drinks.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<div id="checking-data-quality-for-drinks-dataset" class="section level2">
<h2>Checking data quality for drinks dataset</h2>
<p>After loading the data we need to ensure its quality by checking for duplicates and NAs.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># We need to check whether any of the drinks is duplicated
anyDuplicated(drinks)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># We need to check whether there are any NA drinks
anyNA(drinks)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
<p>Based on checking the dataset, there are no missing values or any duplicates.</p>

<p>Consumption of alcoholic beverages differs across geographies and exposes national preferences and traditions in terms of beers, spirits and wines. Looking at the example of wine consumption, highest consumption per capita can be seen for countries with traditionally high production of wine (France, Portugal) while Switzerland and Denmark are more on the side of consumption. Overall, consumption patterns in terms of beverages likely align to a large extend with the national cuisine and food preferences, i.e.Â beer being paired with traditional German style meals.</p>
