# Trump's Approval Margins

Our team has been tasked with the analysis of the net approval rate (i.e. approve- disapprove percentages) for the US president Donald Trump throughout his time in office. Does he have a positive or negative approval rate? Have there been any significants increases or decreases in his net approval rate during his time in the White House?
To answer these questions, we will look at data on all polls that track the president's approval obtained from fivethirtyeight.com (https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings).

To start analysis, firstly we need to load the data! 

```{r, cache=TRUE}

# Import approval polls data
approval_polllist <- vroom::vroom(file = 'data/approval_polllist.csv')
# Take a look at the data
glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use lubridate to fix the dates employing command mdy(), which indicates that order is month day year,
#convert the dates from "character" to "date" type

# Convert modeldate
approval_polllist$modeldate<-mdy(approval_polllist$modeldate)
# Convert startdate
approval_polllist$startdate<-mdy(approval_polllist$startdate)
#Convert enddate
approval_polllist$enddate<-mdy(approval_polllist$enddate)
#Convert createddate
approval_polllist$createddate<-mdy(approval_polllist$createddate)
```

## Graphical visualization
We will calculate the average net approval rate (approve-disapprove percentages) for each week since Trump got into office, and plot the net approval along with the 95% confidence intervals.

```{R Trump,fig.height=5,fig.width=10}

Trump_approval<-approval_polllist%>%
  #Filter to select only Voters from subgrou
filter(subgroup=="Voters")%>%
  #Create the relevant variables: get the week and year from the enddate, and create plotting variable "net approval"
  mutate(date=enddate,week=week(date),year=year(date),net_approval=approve-disapprove)%>%
  group_by(week,year)%>%
  #Calculate the relevant statistics: mean, count, standard dev, standard error, t critical, and CI boundaries
  summarise(mean=mean(net_approval),stdev=sd(net_approval),count=n(),se=stdev/sqrt(count),t_critical=qt(0.975,count-1),lower_bound=mean-t_critical,upper_bound=mean+t_critical)
#Remove outlier
Trump_approval<- Trump_approval[-189,]

#Plot the relevant variables
ggplot(Trump_approval,aes(x=week,fill=as.factor(year)))+scale_fill_manual(values = c("red","green","#66FFFF","#E5CCFF"))+
  geom_line(aes(y=lower_bound))+geom_line(aes(y=mean))+ 
  geom_line(aes(y=upper_bound))+geom_point(aes(y=mean))+
  #Shade the confidence interval
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower_bound,ymax=upper_bound),alpha=0.3)+facet_wrap(~year)+
  #Create a horizontal line at y=0
  geom_hline(yintercept=0, size=1.5, color="orange")+
  #Customize the code, adding titles, legends
  labs(title="Estimating Net Approval (approve-disapprove) for Donald Trump
",subtitle="Weekly average of all polls",x="Week of the year",y="Average Net Approval (%)")+
  
  #Customize the size of the font, scales and background, and gridline colours
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12),legend.position = "none", panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white",
                                colour = "white",
                                size = 0.5, linetype = "solid"),
  panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.5, linetype = 'solid',
                                colour = "grey"), 
  panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.25, linetype = 'solid',
                                colour = "grey")) + 
  #Specify the limits and breaks for the scales
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(-20,-17.5,-15,-12.5,-10,-7.5,-5,-2.5,0,2.5,5.0,7.5))+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0, 13,26,39,52))

```

## Analysing Trump's approval rate throughout his time in office

By looking at Trump's approval rate throughout the years, we can observe his net approval rate has remained negative from his second week on the office. The most significant periods of decline happened in mid 2017 (year in which he started his time as a president) and in year 2020. It is interesting to notice that in year 2020, this decline is coincident with the pandemic peak weeks. In 2018 and 2019, the approval rate remained stable (i.e. no significant declines or increases).


## Comparing confidence intervals in 2020

If we compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020), we can observe that the confidence interval for the second week is wider. The confidence interval is a function of the level of confidence, the standard deviation/variability and the sample size. Since the level of confidence is kept constant at 95%, we can collude that either the variability has increased and/or the sample size has diminished (i.e. less polls were conducted). By analyzing the numerical data, we can confirm that in week 34 the standard deviation increased by 64.7% and the sample size decreased by 11%.
