      <description>Analysis of movies- IMDB dataset Our team has been tasked with an analysis of several factors related to movies. We want to explore, among others, factors on which the financial success of a movie could depend. We will start with a general exploration of the dataset: how many movies belong to each gender category, what is the financial performance of each gender category, and who are the directors. Furthermore, we will delve into ratings distribution and analyse the impact of factors such as Facebook likes and budget on the financial performance of the movie.</description>
